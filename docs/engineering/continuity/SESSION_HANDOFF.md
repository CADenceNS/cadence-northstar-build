## Verified baseline

- Product-certified head: `5cc2b4ab2ee0d25d656db7c08b136f7014ff2a4a`, tree `f764f8622f4d62ca6f62833dc62fded7ff2069e4`
- Last repository head verified before this continuity update: `df33a377ce9e8bf63daa7c34b3746f0c3ef859e5`; documentation-only advancement after product certification.
- PR #29: merged; product certification remains bound to `5cc2b4ab2ee0d25d656db7c08b136f7014ff2a4a`
- PR #30: merged at `4cdd57090b031b5b71bc811f666710dd99451cec`; documentation/continuity only
- Merged-main workflows for PR #29: CI `31984965584`, Runtime `31984965612`, Sprint `31984965614`; all PASS
- Merged-main regression: 421/421 deterministic and 47/47 Playwright
- Expanded commercial roadmap: permanently stored
- Sprint 25: fully reconciled, certified, and merged
- Sprint 26: planned after CF-1; not started
- CF-1A0: implemented pending certification on `feature/cf-1a-tenant-entitlement-core`. Gateway-to-runtime operational requests now carry a gateway-issued, short-lived signed tenant assertion; the runtime verifies it and binds repository scope with `AsyncLocalStorage`. Targeted tests and API TypeScript passed. Database-backed tests, full deterministic/Playwright, CI, Runtime Validation, and Sprint Validation remain pending. The checkpoint is committed locally; push/PR publication is blocked until GitHub credentials are configured.

## Continuity-state rule

The last repository head is the commit inspected before a continuity update, not a requirement that `CURRENT_STATE.md` contain its own eventual commit SHA. Documentation commits may advance `main` beyond that checkpoint. Future sessions must compare the delta and may reconcile documentation-only changes when the product-certified head is unchanged. Product certification and later continuity commits must remain explicitly separate.

## Exact next authorized action

> **Resume CF-1A — Tenant + Entitlement Security Core**

Recommended implementation model: **GPT-5.6 Terra**.

Resume CF-1A from the authenticated tenant-context boundary. Do not begin Sprint 26 before the currently authorized sequencing permits it. Do not rerun protected private-corpus certification; CF-1A0 changes no geometry.
