## Verified baseline

- Product-certified head: `5cc2b4ab2ee0d25d656db7c08b136f7014ff2a4a`, tree `f764f8622f4d62ca6f62833dc62fded7ff2069e4`
- Last repository head verified before this continuity update: `eaead9cb54d9878edc2a6c3f5ea0e5b79bbf8846`, tree `526175ee23096762629f3f4d6472bd7283b18568`
- PR #29: merged; product certification remains bound to `5cc2b4ab2ee0d25d656db7c08b136f7014ff2a4a`
- PR #30: merged at `4cdd57090b031b5b71bc811f666710dd99451cec`; documentation/continuity only
- Merged-main workflows for PR #29: CI `31984965584`, Runtime `31984965612`, Sprint `31984965614`; all PASS
- Merged-main regression: 421/421 deterministic and 47/47 Playwright
- Expanded commercial roadmap: permanently stored
- Sprint 25: fully reconciled, certified, and merged
- Sprint 26: planned after CF-1; not started

## Continuity-state rule

The last repository head is the commit inspected before a continuity update, not a requirement that `CURRENT_STATE.md` contain its own eventual commit SHA. Documentation commits may advance `main` beyond that checkpoint. Future sessions must compare the delta and may reconcile documentation-only changes when the product-certified head is unchanged. Product certification and later continuity commits must remain explicitly separate.

## Exact next authorized action

> **CF-1 — CADence Commercial Multi-Tenant Licensing & Entitlement Foundation**

Recommended implementation model: **GPT-5.6 Terra**.

CF-1 may implement the approved commercial foundation. Do not begin Sprint 26 before the currently authorized sequencing permits it. Do not rerun protected private-corpus certification for this documentation-only repair.
